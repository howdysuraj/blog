Angular, a typescript-based web application framework is Google’s one of the brilliant creations. It has released its latest version which is Angular 14. Here we’re going to talk about what Angular 14 has brought for [Angular developers](https://www.mindinventory.com/hire-angularjs-developers.php){target="_blank"}  in terms of updates and features. Let’s get started with it without any further delay.

## What is New in Angular 14? ##

First things first, let’s see what the Angular 14 release has brought new for all of us:

### Standalone Components will Make the Angular Development Process Easier ###

Standalone components do nothing but streamline the authoring of Angular applications by decreasing the requirement for NgModules. In angular 14, standalone components are in developer preview. They are then all set to be used in your applications for the process of development and exploration.  

But there is a possibility that API can not be stable and could change outside of the regular backward compatibility strategy.  

And the framework will be continuing to build out schematics (such as ng new <app-name> –standalone), as well as document the use cases and learning journey for this updated, streamlined mental model.  

## Typed Angular Forms ##

Angular 14 puts an end to Angular’s [top GitHub issue](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/13721){target="_blank"} which is implementing strict typing for the Angular Reactive Forms Package.<br/>

Typed forms make sure that the values inside of form controls, groups, and arrays are type safe across the entire API surface. This enables safer forms, especially for deeply nested complex cases.  

This feature is specially designed on public requests for comments and design reviews,  which was built upon the prior prototyping, work, and testing of Angular community contributors, including Sonu Kapoor, Netanel Basel, and Cédric Exbrayat.  

Update schematics help with progressive migration to typed forms by enabling you to add typing to existing forms moderately along with complete backward compatibility.  

## Extended Developer Diagnostics ##
New extended diagnostics are built to provide you with an extendable framework that gives you more insight into your templates and how you can improve them.

## Streamlined Best Practices ##
Here Angular 14 is all set to help you experience something that is absolutely designed to make you feel convenient.  

Beginning with new change detection instructions on angular.io, Angular v14 has built-in tools that allow developers to build premium-quality applications, from routing to your code editor, starting with new modification detection instructions on angular.io.
